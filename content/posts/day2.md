## Day 2: ELK Stack Introduction

First of all the 'E' stands for [Elastic Search](https://www.elastic.co/elasticsearch). Elasticsearch is an open source, distributed search and analytics engine built for speed, scale, and AI applications. As a retrieval platform, it stores structured, unstructured, and vector data in real time â€” delivering fast hybrid and vector search, powering observability and security analytics, and enabling AI-driven applications with high performance, accuracy, and relevance.

Then the 'L' stands for [Logstash](https://www.elastic.co/logstash). Logstash dynamically ingests, transforms, and ships your data regardless of format or complexity. Derive structure from unstructured data with grok, decipher geo coordinates from IP addresses, anonymize or exclude sensitive fields, and ease overall processing, using Beats or Elastic Agents.
 
Finally, the 'K' is for [Kibana](https://www.elastic.co/kibana). Run data analytics at speed and scale for observability, security, and search with Kibana. Powerful analysis on any data from any source, from threat intelligence to search analytics, logs to application monitoring, and much more.

Why using ELK stack:

- Centralized logging  
- Flexibility (constomized ingestion)
- Visualization
- Scalability
- Ecosystem (many integrations and community)
- Siems
