## Day 23: What is a Ticketing System?
Ressources :[MyDFIR Channel](https://www.youtube.com/@MyDFIR/)

A **ticketing system** (also known as a help desk system or issue tracking system) is a software tool designed to manage, track, and resolve requests, problems, or tasks in a structured and efficient way. Every new request is logged as a unique "ticket," which becomes a central record for all communication, history, and actions related to that specific issue.

Think of it as a sophisticated, shared to-do list that ensures nothing gets lost or forgotten.

 

### **The Core Concept: The Lifecycle of a Ticket**

Every ticket goes through a standard lifecycle, which provides clarity and accountability.

### **Key Benefits of Using a Ticketing System**

*   **Organization & Prioritization:** Prevents chaos. Tickets are categorized, prioritized (e.g., Low, Medium, High, Critical), and assigned, so the most important issues are handled first.
*   **Accountability & Ownership:** Every ticket has an assignee. Itâ€™s clear who is responsible for resolving which issue, eliminating confusion and finger-pointing.
*   **Knowledge Management:** Tickets create a historical knowledge base. Solutions to past problems can be referenced to quickly resolve new, similar issues.
*   **Efficiency & Automation:** Automates repetitive tasks like routing tickets to the right team, sending status updates, and escalating overdue tickets.
*   **Reporting & Insights:** Provides data to analyze performance. Managers can generate reports on metrics like:
    *   Volume of tickets
    *   Average resolution time
    *   Team/individual workload and performance
    *   Common types of problems

 

### **Common Types of Ticketing Systems**

| Type | Description | Common Examples |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **IT Service Management (ITSM)** | Manages internal IT support requests (e.g., password resets, software installs, hardware issues). | **ServiceNow**, **Jira Service Management**, Freshservice, Zendesk |
| **Customer Support** | Manages inquiries and issues from external customers. | **Zendesk**, **Freshdesk**, Help Scout, Intercom |
| **Project & Task Management** | Tracks tasks, bugs, and features for software development and projects. | **Jira Software**, Asana, Trello, Monday.com |
| **Security Ticketing** | Used in Security Operations Centers (SOCs) to track and investigate security alerts. | **ServiceNow SecOps**, Jira (with custom workflows), Splunk SOAR |

 

### **Key Features to Look For**

*   **Ticket Creation:** Multiple easy ways to create tickets (email, web form, portal, chat).
*   **Automated Routing & Assignment:** Rules to send tickets to the right person or team based on category, keywords, or requester.
*   **SLA Management:** Tracks compliance with Service Level Agreements (e.g., "95% of High-priority tickets must be resolved within 2 hours").
*   **Status Tracking:** Allows users to see where their ticket is in the process (e.g., Open, In Progress, Awaiting Customer, Closed).
*   **Communication Thread:** Keeps all related messages and notes in one place, maintaining context.
*   **Knowledge Base:** A built-in repository of solutions and articles, often generated from resolved tickets.
*   **Reporting & Dashboards:** Visual tools to analyze trends and measure performance.

**In summary, a ticketing system is the central nervous system for organized workflow management. It replaces chaotic methods like email threads and verbal requests with a standardized, transparent, and efficient process for getting work done, whether that work is fixing a bug, helping a customer, or investigating a security alert.**
