## Day 2: ELK Stack Introduction

First of all the 'E' stands for [Elastic Search](https://www.elastic.co/elasticsearch). Elasticsearch is an open source, distributed search and analytics engine built for speed, scale, and AI applications. As a retrieval platform, it stores structured, unstructured, and vector data in real time â€” delivering fast hybrid and vector search, powering observability and security analytics, and enabling AI-driven applications with high performance, accuracy, and relevance.

Then the 'L' stands for [Logstash](https://www.elastic.co/logstash). Logstash dynamically ingests, transforms, and ships your data regardless of format or complexity. Derive structure from unstructured data with grok, decipher geo coordinates from IP addresses, anonymize or exclude sensitive fields, and ease overall processing, using Beats or Elastic Agents.
 
Finally, the 'K' is for [Kibana](https://www.elastic.co/kibana). Run data analytics at speed and scale for observability, security, and search with Kibana. Powerful analysis on any data from any source, from threat intelligence to search analytics, logs to application monitoring, and much more.

Why using ELK stack:

- Centralized logging  
- Flexibility (constomized ingestion)
- Visualization
- Scalability
- Ecosystem (many integrations and community)
- Siems

	```bash
	sudo nano /etc/kibana/kibana.yml
	```
	```bash
	# =================== System: Kibana Server ===================
	# Kibana is served by a back end server. This setting specifies the port to use.
	server.port: 5601

	# Specifies the address to which the Kibana server will bind. IP addresses and host names are both valid values.
	# The default is 'localhost', which usually means remote machines will not be able to connect.
	# To allow connections from remote users, set this parameter to a non-loopback address.
	server.host: your ip address
	```
	Save the file and exit (Ctrl+X, then Y, then Enter).


5. Enable and Start the Kibana Service

	After installation, you must reload the systemd manager configuration to recognize the new service, then start it.

	```bash
	sudo systemctl daemon-reload
	sudo systemctl enable kibana.service
	sudo systemctl start kibana.service
	```

6. Verify the Installation

	Check if the Elasticsearch service is running correctly.

	```bash
	sudo systemctl status elasticsearch.service
	```

7. Generate the Kibana Enrollment Token

	Kibana needs a token to enroll itself with Elasticsearch's security features. Generate this token on the Elasticsearch server.

	```bash
	# Navigate to the Elasticsearch bin directory and generate the token
	cd /usr/share/elasticsearch/bin
	sudo ./elasticsearch-create-enrollment-token --scope kibana
	```

	Copy the long token string that is output. You will need it for the next step.

8. Complete Kibana Setup in the Web Browser

		- Open a web browser on your host machine (e.g., your Mac).
		- Navigate to http://<your-ubuntu-server-ip>:5601 (e.g., http://192.168.1.100:5601).
		- You will be prompted for the Enrollment Token. Paste the token you copied in the previous step and click Enroll.

	The setup process will now ask for a verification code. This code is generated on the Kibana server.

	```bash
	# Navigate to the Kibana bin directory and generate the code
	cd /usr/share/kibana/bin
	sudo ./kibana-verification-code
	```

	Copy the 6-digit code that is displayed. Enter it in the browser window.

9. Log in to Kibana

	 You will now be prompted to log in.

		- Username: elastic
		- Password: Use the password you saved during the Elasticsearch installation. If you did not save it, you can reset it using the elasticsearch-reset-password tool.

10. Generate Encryption Keys

	For production-like environments, you should generate encryption keys for Kibana's saved objects and store them in its keystore.


	```bash
	# Navigate to the Kibana bin directory
	cd /usr/share/kibana/bin

	# Generate the encryption keys. Copy the output.
	sudo ./kibana-encryption-keys generate

	# Add each generated key to the Kibana keystore
	sudo ./kibana-keystore add xpack.encryptedSavedObjects.encryptionKey
	# Enter the value for xpack.encryptedSavedObjects.encryptionKey when prompted.

	sudo ./kibana-keystore add xpack.reporting.encryptionKey
	# Enter the value for xpack.reporting.encryptionKey when prompted.

	sudo ./kibana-keystore add xpack.security.encryptionKey
	# Enter the value for xpack.security.encryptionKey when prompted.
	```

	After all configuration, restart both services to ensure all changes take effect.

	```bash
	sudo systemctl restart kibana.service
	sudo systemctl restart elasticsearch.service
	```

	You have now successfully installed Kibana and connected it to your Elasticsearch node. You can access the Kibana dashboard at http://<your-ubuntu-server-ip>:5601 to begin visualizing your data.

## Day 6: Elastic Agent and Fleet Server Introduction


### **Elastic Agent and Fleet Server: A Centralized Management Revolution**

#### **1. The Problem They Solve**

Traditionally, collecting logs, metrics, and security data from servers involved installing multiple lightweight data shippers (like Beats: Filebeat, Metricbeat, Winlogbeat, etc.) and managing each one individually. This approach became complex and hard to maintain at scale:
*   **Management Overhead:** Updating configuration files across thousands of servers.
*   **Resource Usage:** Running multiple independent processes.
*   **Orchestration Complexity:** Coordinating many different agents.

#### **2. The Solution: A Single, Unified Agent**

**Elastic Agent** is a single, unified agent that you can deploy to your hosts (servers, containers, laptops) to collect data and send it to the Elastic Stack.

*   **All-in-One:** It consolidates the functionality of all the individual Beats and more into one agent.
*   **Centralized Management:** Its configuration is not managed on the host itself but is **centrally controlled from Kibana** via a feature called **Fleet**.
*   **Policy-Driven:** You define a **policy** (what data to collect, what to do with it) in Kibana, and Fleet pushes that policy to all your Elastic Agents automatically.

#### **3. The Brain: Fleet in Kibana**

**Fleet** is the web-based UI inside Kibana where you manage your entire fleet of Elastic Agents.
*   You add **integrations** (pre-built packages for collecting data from sources like Nginx, AWS, MySQL, Windows Event Logs, etc.).
*   You create **agent policies** that combine these integrations and define settings like the output (where to send data).
*   You get a full overview of all your agents: their status, version, and last check-in time.

#### **4. The Coordinator: Fleet Server**

This is the critical link between Fleet (in Kibana) and the Elastic Agents running on your hosts.

*   **Purpose:** The Fleet Server acts as a **secure communication gateway**.
*   **How it Works:**
    1.  You install a Fleet Server (which is itself a specialized Elastic Agent) in your environment.
    2.  All your other Elastic Agents do **not** talk directly to Kibana or Elasticsearch. Instead, they **check in with the Fleet Server**.
    3.  The Fleet Server relays information *from* the agents *to* Kibana (e.g., agent status) and, most importantly, it delivers new policies *from* Kibana *to* the agents.

*   **Deployment:** The Fleet Server **must** be installed on a host that is highly available and has a low-latency connection to both your other agents and your Elasticsearch cluster. It's often installed on its own dedicated VM or a Kubernetes pod.


### **Why This Architecture is Powerful**

1.  **Scalability:** The Fleet Server handles the communication load, preventing your Elasticsearch cluster from being overwhelmed by thousands of agents checking in directly.
2.  **Security:** Agents only need network access to the Fleet Server and Elasticsearch, not to Kibana. This reduces the attack surface.
3.  **Efficiency:** Centralized management means you can change what data is collected across your entire infrastructure with just a few clicks in a web UI, without ever logging into a server.
4.  **Reliability:** The agent is self-healing. If it gets into a bad state, it will automatically restart itself and reconnect to the Fleet Server.


### **Visualizing the Data Flow**

The entire architecture can be summarized in this data flow:

<img src="/images/fleet.png" style="display: block; margin: auto; max-width: 80%;" />


**In summary:**
*   **Elastic Agent** is the worker that collects data on your hosts.
*   **Fleet** is the mission control center in Kibana.
*   **Fleet Server** is the dispatcher that ensures instructions from mission control reach the workers and that status updates from the workers get back.

This modernized approach is the foundation for the Elastic Stack's capabilities in observability and security, enabling you to manage vast, distributed infrastructures with ease.

## Day 7: Elastic Agent and Fleet Server Setup Tutorial

### **Architecture Overview**
*   **ELK Server (IP: 172.16.193.153):** Runs Elasticsearch and Kibana. Fleet management is done here.
*   **Fleet Server Host (New VM):** A dedicated server (Linux) that runs the Fleet Server component.
*   **Windows Server 2022 Host (New VM):** The server we want to monitor, which will run the Elastic Agent.

---

## **Part 1: Prerequisites - The ELK Server**
Ensure your ELK server (`172.16.193.153`) is fully operational and accessible.
1.  Elasticsearch is running and healthy.
2.  Kibana is running on port `5601` and you can log in.
3.  The servers that will host the Fleet Server and Elastic Agent can reach the ELK server on port `9200` (Elasticsearch) and `5601` (Kibana).

---

## **Part 2: Configure Kibana for Fleet & Generate Fleet Server Policy**

### **1. Access Fleet in Kibana**
1.  Open your browser and go to: `http://172.16.193.153:5601`.
2.  Navigate to **Fleet**:
    *   Click the main menu (â˜°) â†’ **Management** â†’ **Fleet**.

### **2. Quick Initial Setup (If prompted)**
If it's your first time in Fleet, you might be guided through a quick setup. The most critical step is to **add an Elasticsearch output**. It should already be configured to use your local Elasticsearch (`http://localhost:9200`). Verify this.

### **3. Generate a Fleet Server Policy**
The Fleet Server *is* an Elastic Agent, so it needs a policy to run. We create this policy first.

1.  In Fleet, go to the **Agent Policies** tab.
2.  Click **Create agent policy**.
3.  Give it a descriptive name: `Fleet Server Policy`.
4.  **Toggle on** **"Agent monitoring"** and **"Fleet Server"**.
    *   Enabling "Fleet Server" is the key. This tells the agent to run the special Fleet Server service.
5.  **Uncheck** **"Collect system logs and metrics"**. We want this agent to be dedicated to running the Fleet Server, not collecting host data.
6.  Click **Create policy**.

---

## **Part 3: Set Up the Fleet Server Host**

You need a new server (Linux is recommended) dedicated to running the Fleet Server. It must have network connectivity to *both* the ELK server *and* the agents it will manage.

### **1. Get the Installation Command for Fleet Server**
1.  In Kibana Fleet, go to the **Agents** tab.
2.  Click **Add agent**.
3.  **Select the Policy:** Choose the `Fleet Server Policy` you just created from the dropdown.
4.  **Configure the Fleet Server host:**
    *   This is the most important step. In the `Fleet Server host` input box, you **must** specify the address that **other agents will use to connect to this Fleet Server**.
    *   If the server's IP is `172.16.193.154`, enter: `https://172.16.193.154:8220`
    *   *Remember this IP/hostname; you will need it for all agents.*
5.  **Select an Operating System:** Select **Linux** (assuming your Fleet Server host is Linux).
6.  **Copy the Install Command:** The command will look like the one below. **Copy it.**

```bash
sudo curl -L -O https://artifacts.elastic.co/downloads/beats/elastic-agent/elastic-agent-8.13.0-linux-x86_64.tar.gz
sudo tar xzvf elastic-agent-8.13.0-linux-x86_64.tar.gz
cd elastic-agent-8.13.0-linux-x86_64
sudo ./elastic-agent install --url=https://172.16.193.153:8220 --fleet-server-es=https://172.16.193.153:9200 --fleet-server-service-token=AAEAAWVsYXN0aWMvZmxlZXQtc2VydmVyL3Rva2VuLTE3MTU5Nzc4MTk1MTC --fleet-server-policy=fleet-server-policy --fleet-server-es-insecure --fleet-server-insecure-http
```

### **2. Run the Command on the Fleet Server Host**
1.  SSH into your new Linux server (`172.16.193.154`).
2.  **Paste and run the entire command** you copied from Kibana.
3.  The script will download, install, and enroll the Elastic Agent, which will then start the Fleet Server service.

### **3. Verify in Kibana**
1.  Go back to the **Fleet** â†’ **Agents** tab in Kibana.
2.  Within a minute, you should see a new agent enrolled. Its **Status** should be **Healthy**.
3.  Check the **Host** column â€“ it should show the hostname of your Fleet Server host.

## **Part 4: Add the Windows Server 2022 Agent**

Now we connect the Windows server to our new infrastructure.

### **1. Get the Installation Command for Windows**
1.  In Kibana Fleet, go to the **Agents** tab.
2.  Click **Add agent**.
3.  **Select the Policy:** Choose the default **Elastic Cloud agent policy** or create a new one (e.g., `windows-servers`).
4.  **Configure the Fleet Server host:** This is critical. Enter the address of the Fleet Server you just set up: `https://172.16.193.154:8220`
5.  **Select an Operating System:** Select **Windows**.
6.  **Copy the Install Command:** The command will be for PowerShell. **Copy it.**

```powershell
curl -L -O https://artifacts.elastic.co/downloads/beats/elastic-agent/elastic-agent-8.13.0-windows-x86_64.zip
Expand-Archive .\elastic-agent-8.13.0-windows-x86_64.zip
cd elastic-agent-8.13.0-windows-x86_64
.\elastic-agent.exe install --url=https://172.16.193.154:8220 --enrollment-token=SFMyNTY...
```

### **2. Run the Command on Windows Server 2022**
1.  Log into your Windows Server 2022 VM.
2.  Open **PowerShell as an Administrator**.
3.  **Paste and run the entire command** you copied from Kibana.
4.  The installer will download and install the Elastic Agent as a Windows service. It will enroll with the Fleet Server and receive its policy.

### **3. Verify in Kibana and Check Data**
1.  Go back to the **Fleet** â†’ **Agents** tab in Kibana.
2.  You should now see a second agent listed. Its **Status** should become **Healthy**.
3.  The **Host** column will show the hostname of your Windows server.
4.  To see data, go to **Analytics** â†’ **Discover**. Select the `logs-*`, `metrics-*`, or `.ds-logs-system.syslog-*` data view to see logs and metrics from your Windows host.

## **Troubleshooting & Key Points**

*   **Firewalls are the #1 Enemy:** Ensure all necessary ports are open:
    *   **Fleet Server Host (`172.16.193.154`):** Must allow **INBOUND** on port `8220` from all agents (and Kibana).
    *   **ELK Server (`172.16.193.153`):** Must allow **INBOUND** on port `9200` from the Fleet Server and agents.
    *   **Agents:** Must be able to reach the Fleet Server on `8220` and Elasticsearch on `9200`.
*   **Fleet Server Host Setting:** The `Fleet Server host` value you set when adding an agent **must be the address that the agent uses to reach the Fleet Server**, which may be different from what Kibana uses.
*   **Logs:** If an agent isn't healthy, check its logs:
    *   **Linux:** `/opt/Elastic/Agent/data/elastic-agent.log`
    *   **Windows:** `C:\Program Files\Elastic\Agent\data\elastic-agent.log`
